## CS 465 Computer Graphics Course Assignment 3
# Realistic Rendering on Parametric Surfaces
The aim of this project is to learn implementation of parametric curves and texture types.

The torus knot is used for the parametric equations.
The parametric texture mapping is used for the texture implementations.

To set the project environment, the http server must be used unless the outsourcing texture images cause the cross origin policy error.
